<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master student of Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/index.htm">Reasoning and Learning Research Group of NJU</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0jjQo8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Yang Gao</a>. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computing Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai.

My research interests lie in the artificial intelligence, computational game theory, and reinforcement learning. I design and implement novel algorithms and desicion systems that enable agents more intelligent and more efficient. Recently, I am specifically interested in game AI, aiming at exploring enhanced techniques and frameworks (with ML, RL, SL, LLM etc.) for building powerful AI agents in computer games.

Besides, I am passionate about traveling.
