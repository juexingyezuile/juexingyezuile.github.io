<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently an AI engineer of Game Dept. at <a href="https://grow.163.com">GrowthEase Div.</a> of <a href="https://ir.netease.com/">NetEase</a>.

I received my M.E. degree in Computer Technology at the [<a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/index.htm">Reasoning and Learning Research Group</a> & <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a> & <a href="https://keysoftlab.nju.edu.cn/main.htm">State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology</a>] of Nanjing University, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://is.nju.edu.cn/d3/56/c58208a643926/page.htm">Yang Gao</a>. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computing Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai.

My research interests lie in the artificial intelligence, computational game theory, and reinforcement learning. I design and implement novel algorithms and desicion systems that enable agents more intelligent and more efficient. Recently, I am specifically interested in game AI, aiming at exploring enhanced techniques and frameworks (with ML, RL, IL, LLM etc.) for building powerful AI agents in computer games.

Besides, I am passionate about traveling.
